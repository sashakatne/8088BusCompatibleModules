To run the simulation, you need to have the following files downloaded and placed in the same directory as the project:

1. interface.sv
2. memorio.sv (The Moore FSM Memory/IO module)
3. top_interface.sv (The top level module that instantiates the Moore FSM Memory/IO module and the Intel 8088)
4. busops.txt file that contains the bus operations for the Intel 8088 Interface module
5. run.do file that details the simulation commands
6. Memory initialization files that can be generated by the memfilegenerator.py script
7. Intel 8088 Interface module

Extra Credit Items:

8. memorio_mealy.sv (The Mealy variant of the FSM Memory/IO module)
9. memorio_tb.sv (The self-checking testbench for the Moore FSM Memory/IO module)
